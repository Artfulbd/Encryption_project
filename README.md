# Encryption_project
Basically it is an encryption decryption program. By my own algorithm, Developed after completing Data Structure course.. For me and my friend.
Without prior knowledge of cryptography, developed due to my own interest and satisfaction. I was on my 3rd or 4th semister.
1. Symetric algorithm.
2. Cipher text will be different every time for same plain text, but length will be same.


* Sample

      plain text            |                                     ciphertext
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   hello world              | 110 87 103 77 99 80 114 95 111 95 | 116 108 102 86 108 95 122 103 112 85 |
